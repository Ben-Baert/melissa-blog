title: Why I chose to study at Open University and become a 'Digital Nomad Student'

When I was younger, a high school friend of mine said something to me with such determination that I wanted to defy it right away. 

She said, "let's face it, you'll never leave Western Sydney. You'll never afford to live anywhere else. Even if you become a lawyer, you'll stay here and be a Western Sydney lawyer and never leave."

So naturally, within the first 2 years of graduating high school, I travelled to Fiji, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand, went to the London Olympics, visited Paris, Rome and London for the first time, and returned to my mum's homeland, the Philippines, for the second time in my life (the first being when I was two years old). 

I then moved out to an apartment at my university, UNSW, in Randwick, far out of Western Sydney. After that, I got it in my head that I would move to Europe and attend university in Belgium, since I was sick of law school and art school. Unlike in Sydney, you can enroll in any degree in Belgium without any prerequisites or certain marks (except for Medicine, for which you need to pass an exam). So, in 2013, I packed up my essentials and began my 'language year' in Leuven, Belgium to learn Dutch in order to attend university at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.
 
 I managed to get a C1 in Dutch and did about a year and a half of Biology at the KUL. However, I wanted more freedom. I wanted to be able to travel whenever I want, wherever I want. During my time at the KUL, I couldn't travel back to my home country, Australia, during the summer months, since we had exams during December and January. I lived centrally in Europe but felt pretty trapped and unable to travel as much as I wanted.

 So, with my boyfriend's encouragement, I enrolled in a BSc. Mathematics and Statistics at the Open University (in Great Britain), transferring all the science credits I'd accrued at the KUL.

 So, what has this done for me?

 For the first time in three years, I was able to travel home and spend Christmas with my family during the summer in 2016. I was able to bring my study books with me, and complete and submit assignments online. I still had great support from OU because my tutors are reachable by both email and telephone. I could study anywhere I wanted, and not feel tied to one place. 



 Since I'm already 24 years old, I was concerned that I wasn't developing my career simply because I had changed degrees. Previously, I was bogged down with commuting, or going to classes at physical locations during the day, and managing a generally very all consuming student life. Since the Open University allows its students to continue working and study during their free time (you can pick and choose what sort of workload you want), I'm now able to start building a career and balace my day with work, study and play (play being, for example, swimming at Avoca Beach on boxing day back in NSW).
