</div>

<p>The constant, speedy development in STEM, particularly technology, has ensured that our working world has changed significantly. We no longer have to be tied to 9-5 jobs or to a small, dark cubicle in an office somewhere, counting down the days to your next holiday away to sunnier locations. It is now possible to be a ‘digital nomad,’ where you can develop a location-independent business and career pretty much <em>anywhere in the world</em> from your laptop!</p>
<p>Interested, but need a bit more convincing? Here are top 5 reasons why being a Digital Nomad blows having a 9-5 job out of the water.</p>

<h3 id="you-can-work-in-any-location-in-the-world-as-long-as-you-have-internet-access.">1. You can work in any location in the world, as long as you have internet access.</h3>
<p>As a digital nomad, you develop a career that you can take along with you. If you have a laptop and access to the internet, you’re good to go!</p>
<p>A lot of digital nomad ‘hubs,’ like Chiang Mai in Thailand, are full of ‘coworking spaces,’ or spaces that you can rent on a monthy basis to use as an office. Such spaces are usually fitted out with computers and wifi, and can sometimes feature ammenities like a kitchen and shower.</p>
<p>For example, [Shambho Open Office] in Gent has a fancy rain shower, and many open offices on the Gent Coworking site have kitchens so you can fix yourself a snack when you need it. Pretty convenient!</p>
<h3 id="experience-the-world-and-have-a-fulfilling-life-without-waiting-for-time-off-or-retirement.">2. Experience the world and have a fulfilling life without waiting for time off or retirement.</h3>
<p>The beaten track usually involves graduating from university, applying and getting a graduate position, and working a 9-5 to climb up the career ladder. The entire time, you’re usually tied to one office in one place. Any exploration of the world is limited to the time off you get to go on vacation.</p>
<p>If you want to go on an even longer vacation, you often have to wait till retirement, but by then, you may no longer have the youthful energy you once had to hike to waterfalls in Laos or surf in Rio Di Janeiro.</p>
<p>Why wait till the end of your career to <em>fully enjoy the world around you?</em></p>
<p>As a digital nomad, you can explore the world while you’re still young <em>and</em> develop your career. Doesn’t that sound exciting?</p>
<h3 id="be-your-own-boss.">3. Be your own boss.</h3>
<p>Being a digital nomad requires a lot of self-discipline. It’s no secret that location independent work relies heavily on your time management abilities and motivation. However, if being able to decide when, where, and how you do your work, and you prefer to be a self-driven, independent worker, then being a digital nomad may be for you.</p>
<p>You can be your own boss, especially if you have your own business! Even as an employee of a company, you can still be your own boss by planning out how to achieve your goals and complete projects.</p>
<h3 id="you-can-tailor-your-career-and-working-hours-to-fit-your-lifestyle-and-needs.">4. You can tailor your career and working hours to fit your lifestyle and needs.</h3>
<p>This one is quite similar to no. 3, however it is appealing in its own right. Don’t mesh well with the typical 9-5 working hours? Have a family you would like to spend more time with at home, or have an illness that prevents you from working typical hours? What if you are a night owl, or prefer to use the daytime to go hiking and swimming and the nighttime to work?</p>
<p>Then being a digital nomad means that you can tailor your work to fit your lifestyle, instead of the other way round. Why not make your career work for you?</p>
<h3 id="being-a-digital-nomad-pushes-you-out-of-your-comfort-zone-making-you-develop-as-a-person.">5. Being a digital nomad pushes you out of your comfort zone, making you develop as a person.</h3>
<p>Finally, being your own boss and location-independent can definitely put you outside of your comfort zone. However, being outside of your comfort zone is exactly where you grow and develop as a person.</p>
<p>In fact, the skills that you gain from this lifestyle, like self-motivation, discipline, and independent thinking are all skills that are attractive to future employers. They are also skills that are vital for running your own business.</p>
<p>So why wait? If this lifestyle appeals to you, then start mapping out your dream job and make a plan to make it a reality!</p>
